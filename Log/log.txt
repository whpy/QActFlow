it is found that the newly constructed function involving y-derivative
(yyDeriv, xyDeriv) in streamfuncmodified exists unknown bug. As a temporary 
expediency, the alternative solution is replacing by double times y-deriv or 
combination of x-deri and y-deriv. Though the xxDeriv is reliable, but to be
safe, we decided to replace all the double derivatives function by the measure
we mentioned above.
