it is found that the newly constructed function involving y-derivative
(yyDeriv, xyDeriv) in streamfuncmodified exists unknown bug. As a temporary 
expediency, the alternative solution is replacing by double times y-deriv or 
combination of x-deri and y-deriv. Though the xxDeriv is reliable, but to be
safe, we decided to replace all the double derivatives function by the measure
we mentioned above.

the unknown bug that function to maintain the symmetry of spectral space causes a series
of covert bug while Fwd Bwd process especially on y-axis. so we temporarily disable such 
function including the cutoff function(we set them all 1.0).
