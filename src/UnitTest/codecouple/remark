in this lab, we simultaneously test the decouple of the both fields 
Q and vorticity Wz.

the streamfunc_dec without any modification has been tested the decouple effect
(by input the zero field) has been tested

control0 contains the decouple result(streamfunc_decdec)

control1 contains the decouple result(streamfunc, dt = 0.01)
